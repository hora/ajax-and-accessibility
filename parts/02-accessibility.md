Quote from MDN's page ["What is
accessibility?"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility)

When making technology design decisions, we should
consider how our products can be interacted with by:
  
- blind people, colour blind people
- D/deaf people, people that are hard of hearing
- people with motor disabilities
- people with various cognitive disabilities

- According to WebAIM, about 20% of people are disabled

- It's common to think of disability as a medical
  condition, but disability is often limiting only when
  diverse bodies and minds interact with inacessible
  technology design

- Designing web experiences that are as accessible as
  possible for disabled people also benefit everyone else

- For example, designing technology that can be used with
  only one arm/hand benefits:

    - amputees
    - people with broken fingers, wrists, arms, etc.
    - someone holding a phone in one hand and a dog leash
      in the other
